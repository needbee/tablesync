<p>This page is a proposal for a simple tabular data table synchronization algorithm that is easily implementable by developers who are comfortable with basic database and web service programming.</p>

<p>The web brought the thin-client paradigm back to the forefront. In this paradigm, data is stored in a single server-side database, so no data synchronization is needed. With the advent of mobile applications, however, the thick client is back. In this paradigm, mobile users have a number of expectations that cannot be met by a single server-side database:</p>

<ul>
<li>They expect that their data is available and editable whether or not they have an internet connection.</li>
<li>They expect that their data is synchronized between multiple devices (and the web interface, if there is one).</li>
<li>They expect this synchronization to be transparent and reliable: they should not need to know when data is up-to-date or not, and they should not need to reconcile conflicts.</li>
</ul>

The following is a proposal for a simple way to achieve these goals. It's not a foolproof algorithm, but it should work for most basic cases. In addition to the above requirements, the following design principles were followed:

<ul>
<li>Synchronziation happens at the field level. If the user changes field A on a record on one device and field B on another record elsewhere, both updates should be preserved.</li> 
<li>As much as possible, standand relational database paradigms should be used on both the client and server side. Any restrictions on table design or extra metadata stored should be minimal.</li>
<li>Device time can be considered reliable for the sake of versioning. Increasing user of network time servers makes this more likely. In the case of a device getting out of sync, this algorithm is designed for situations where changes are infrequent enough and changes are low-risk enough that a problematic error is unlikely.</li>
</ul>
